# ObjectInspector Challenge

Welcome to the ObjectInspector Challenge! In this repository, your task is to write unit tests to ensure the `ObjectInspector` class is fully tested and robust.

## Challenge Overview

The `ObjectInspector` class is designed to inspect objects, including nested structures, and return a flattened list of their types. It handles complex cases like circular references and allows configurable options such as maximum recursion depth and whether to include object attributes.

Your challenge is to create a comprehensive suite of unit tests that fully cover the functionality of this class. 


## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Review the `ObjectInspector` class in `object_inspector.py`.
3. Write your unit tests using your preferred testing framework (e.g., `unittest`, `pytest`).
4. Ensure your tests cover all the challenge requirements.

## Evaluation

Your submission will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- **Coverage**: Does your test suite cover all the specified requirements?
- **Correctness**: Do your tests accurately verify the behavior of the `ObjectInspector` class?
- **Robustness**: Does your test suite handle edge cases and unexpected scenarios?
- **Code Quality**: Is your test code well-organized, readable, and maintainable?

Good luck, and happy testing!
